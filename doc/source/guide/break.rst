break
======

The ``break`` statement can only be used inside ``switch``, ``for``, ``for x in`` and ``while`` statements. The ``break`` statement transfers directly after the innermost loop / switch case.

It is planned to extend ``break`` to support breaking any number of loops with a single statement.
