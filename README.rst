Exoself is a programming language, runtime and compiler designed and written by Florian Noeding (florian AT noeding DOT com).
For more details see either my blog http://code2code.wordpress.com or http://exoself.de



Quickstart
----------

1. download, compile and install llvm (at the time of writing this 2.4)
2. add the llvm binary directory to your PATH variable if it's not already there
3. in the root directory execute ``./waf configure`` followd by ``./waf`` and ``./waf check``


Notes for OS X users
--------------------
Instead of installing llvm manually you can also try to use llvm from macports:
sudo port install llvm
